JellyMac & *Arr Suite: Cooperative Handoff Guide
=================================================================

Why do this?
------------
This setup is mainly for users who already use Sonarr and/or Radarr and want
to integrate JellyMac into their existing automation workflow. If you do
not use the Arr apps, or do not need their advanced renaming and metadata
features, you can use JellyMac on its own — this handoff is not required
nor specifically recommended for normal operation. Please note - adding this step increases
automation complexity and potential points of failure.

What is the Cooperative Handoff?
--------------------------------
JellyMac can work seamlessly with Sonarr (TV) and Radarr (movies).
JellyMac handles initial downloads and basic filename sanitation, then hands
off files to Sonarr/Radarr for final renaming, metadata, and library
management.

Key Points:
- JellyMac creates simple filenames (e.g., Show Name - S01E01.mkv).
- Sonarr/Radarr will rename and enrich these files after import.
- Jellyfin displays your media correctly as long as filenames include Show
  Name, Season, and Episode (for TV) or Movie Name and Year (for movies).
- The main difference is only visible if you browse files directly in Finder
  or another file manager.

Quick Workflow Overview
-----------------------
1. Drop or download media into your JellyMac DROP_FOLDER.
2. JellyMac processes and moves files to a "handoff" folder.
3. Sonarr/Radarr monitor the handoff folder, import, rename, and move files
   to your final library.
4. Jellyfin updates its library (triggered by Sonarr/Radarr or JellyMac).

Setup Steps
-----------

If Sonarr/Radarr Are Running Locally on Your Mac
------------------------------------------------
- You do not need to set up a network share or worry about path mapping.
- Simply choose or create an empty local folder for your TV and Movie handoff folders
  (e.g., /Users/yourusername/Media_Imports/TV_Handoff).
- Both JellyMac and Sonarr/Radarr will use the same local paths once
  configured.
- Follow the rest of the steps below, using your chosen local folders for
  both apps.

1. Create Handoff Folders
   - Choose a folder for TV handoff and one for Movie handoff.
   - Both JellyMac and Sonarr/Radarr must have read/write access.
   - Example (local Mac):
       TV:    /Volumes/media_storage/Media_Imports/TV_Handoff
       Movie: /Volumes/media_storage/Media_Imports/Movie_Handoff
   - Example (Mac with Linux server share mounted at /Volumes/media_storage):
       TV:    /Volumes/media_storage/Media_Imports/TV_Handoff
       Movie: /Volumes/media_storage/Media_Imports/Movie_Handoff
   - On the server, these might appear as:
       /srv/media_storage/Media_Imports/TV_Handoff

2. Configure JellyMac
   - Edit Configuration.txt.
   - Set:
       DROP_FOLDER = your TV handoff folder (as seen by your Mac)
   - (Optional) To avoid redundant Jellyfin scans, set:
       ENABLE_JELLYFIN_SCAN_MOVIES="false"
       ENABLE_JELLYFIN_SCAN_SHOWS="false"

3. Configure Sonarr/Radarr
   - In Sonarr/Radarr, set the "Watch Folder" (or use "Manual Import") to
     the handoff folder (as seen by the server).
   - Ensure Sonarr/Radarr have permission to read/write in these folders.

4. (Optional) Transmission Integration
   - Set Transmission's "Move completed downloads to" path to your JellyMac
     DROP_FOLDER.
   - JellyMac will process completed downloads and move them to the
     handoff folder for Sonarr/Radarr.

Path Mapping Example
--------------------
  System         | TV Handoff Path Example
  -------------- | ------------------------------------------
  JellyMac       | /Volumes/media_storage/Media_Imports/TV_Handoff
  Sonarr (Linux) | /srv/media_storage/Media_Imports/TV_Handoff

Test Your Setup
---------------
- Drop a test file in DROP_FOLDER.
- Confirm it appears in the handoff folder.
- Check Sonarr/Radarr logs for import activity.
- Confirm file appears in your final library with correct metadata.

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------
- Permissions: Both JellyMac and Sonarr/Radarr must have read/write
  access to the handoff folders.
- Path Consistency: Double-check that each app uses the correct path for its
  environment.
- Logs: Check logs for JellyMac (~/JellyMac/logs/), Sonarr, and
  Radarr if files are not imported.
- Naming: If Sonarr/Radarr do not import a file, check their logs for parsing
  errors.

Summary
-------
With this setup, you can use JellyMac for flexible media ingestion and
let Sonarr/Radarr handle final organization and metadata. Careful path and
permission setup is key to a smooth workflow.

---

Note:
- If both JellyMac and Sonarr/Radarr (and the Jellyfin server) are
  running on the same Mac, you can use any local folder for handoff—no
  network shares or path mapping needed.
- The "Drone Factory" folder is deprecated in recent Sonarr versions; use
  "Watch Folder" or "Manual Import" instead.
