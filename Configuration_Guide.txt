================================================================= JellyMac AMP Configuration Guide
This guide explains the settings available in the
lib/jellymac_config.sh file. This file is crucial for
customizing JellyMac AMP to your specific setup and
preferences.

To configure JellyMac AMP:

Navigate to the lib directory within your JellyMac_AMP
folder (e.g., cd ~/JellyMac_AMP/lib).

If it doesn't already exist, copy the example
configuration: cp jellymac_config.example.sh jellymac_config.sh

Open jellymac_config.sh in a text editor (like nano
or TextEdit) and modify the settings as described below.

Save your changes and restart JellyMac AMP for them to
take effect.

General Tips for Configuration:

Paths: Use full, absolute paths for all directory
settings (e.g., /Users/yourname/Movies instead of
~/Movies or Movies).

Quotes: Keep values enclosed in double quotes ("value").
This is important for paths or values that might contain
spaces or special characters.

Boolean Values: Settings expecting "true" or "false"
should use these exact lowercase strings.

                    CORE CONFIGURATION

These settings control the general behavior of JellyMac AMP.

JELLYMAC_PROJECT_ROOT
Purpose: Automatically determines the project's main
installation directory.
How it works: Assumes jellymac_config.sh is in the
lib subdirectory of the project root.
Action: Usually, you do not need to change this.

AUTO_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES
Purpose: Controls if JellyMac AMP should automatically
try to install missing required tools (like yt-dlp,
flock, transmission-cli) using Homebrew when it
starts.
Values:
- "true": Enable automatic installation.
- "false": Disable automatic installation (default).
Note: Requires Homebrew to be installed on your Mac.
If "false", you must install dependencies manually.

MAIN_LOOP_SLEEP_INTERVAL
Purpose: Sets how often (in seconds) the main JellyMac
AMP script checks for new clipboard content and scans
the drop folder.
Units: Seconds
Range: 1-60 (recommended)
Default: 5
Note: Lower values (e.g., 1-5) make the script more
responsive but use slightly more CPU. Higher values
(e.g., 10-30) are less responsive but lighter on CPU.

AUTO_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS
Purpose: Controls if JellyMac AMP should automatically
create essential directories (like DROP_FOLDER,
destination libraries, ERROR_DIR) if they don't
exist when the script starts.
Values:
- "true": Enable automatic directory creation (default).
- "false": Disable. The script will error and exit if
configured paths are not found.

                       MEDIA PATHS

Define the source and destination locations for your media.
These paths MUST be correctly set for JellyMac AMP to function.
Ensure JellyMac AMP has read/write permissions for these
locations.

DROP_FOLDER
Purpose: The main folder JellyMac AMP monitors for new
media files or folders (e.g., completed torrents,
manually dropped files).
Required: Yes
Example: "/Users/yourname/Downloads/MediaDrop"
Note: This path must exist or be creatable if
AUTO_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS is "true".

DEST_DIR_MOVIES
Purpose: The final root directory where processed movies
will be organized. Each movie will typically get its
own subfolder here.
Required: Yes
Example: "/Volumes/Media/Movies"
Note: Must be writable by JellyMac AMP.

DEST_DIR_SHOWS
Purpose: The final root directory where processed TV shows
will be organized. Shows are typically structured as
ShowName/Season XX/episode_files.
Required: Yes
Example: "/Volumes/Media/TV Shows"
Note: Must be writable by JellyMac AMP.

DEST_DIR_YOUTUBE
Purpose: The final destination for downloaded YouTube
videos.
Required: Yes, if ENABLE_CLIPBOARD_YOUTUBE is "true".
Example: "/Volumes/Media/YouTube"
Note: Must be writable. If YouTube processing is
disabled, this path is not used.

LOCAL_DIR_YOUTUBE
Purpose: A temporary local directory on your Mac where
YouTube videos are downloaded by yt-dlp before being
moved to DEST_DIR_YOUTUBE.
Required: Yes, if ENABLE_CLIPBOARD_YOUTUBE is "true".
Example: "/Users/yourname/JellyMacTemp/YouTubeDownloads"
Note: Ensure this location has enough free space for
your largest expected YouTube downloads. This directory
should ideally be on a fast local drive (like your Mac's
internal SSD).

ERROR_DIR
Purpose: A directory where JellyMac AMP will move items
that it fails to process correctly (quarantine). This
helps keep your DROP_FOLDER clean.
Required: Yes
Default: "${JELLYMAC_PROJECT_ROOT}/_error_quarantine_files"
(a folder named _error_quarantine_files inside your
JellyMac_AMP project directory).
Note: Created automatically if needed and
AUTO_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS is "true".

               MEDIA PROCESSING SETTINGS

Control how media files are identified, cleaned, and handled.

MAIN_MEDIA_EXTENSIONS
Purpose: A list of file extensions that JellyMac AMP
recognizes as primary video media files to be processed.
Format: Array of strings, e.g., (".mkv" ".mp4")
Default: Includes common video formats like ".mkv",
".mp4", ".avi", ".mov", ".wmv", ".flv", ".webm", ".ts".
Required: Yes. Ensure your common media file types are
listed.

ASSOCIATED_FILE_EXTENSIONS
Purpose: A list of file extensions for files that should
be processed alongside the main media file (e.g.,
subtitles, NFO files). These files will be renamed to
match the processed media file name and moved with it.
Format: Array of strings, e.g., (".srt" ".nfo")
Default: Includes common subtitle formats (".srt", ".sub",
".ass", ".idx", ".vtt") and ".nfo" files.
Optional: Yes. Add or remove extensions as needed.

MEDIA_TAG_BLACKLIST
Purpose: A list of tags (using regex patterns) to remove
from filenames during the cleaning process. This helps
create cleaner, more consistent names for your media
server to parse.
Format: Regex patterns separated by | (pipe), case
insensitive.
Example: "1080p|720p|WEB[- ]?DL|WEBRip"
Default: A comprehensive list of common quality tags,
codecs, and release group patterns.
Note: Be careful when editing; incorrect regex can lead
to unexpected or incomplete filename changes. Test changes
on sample filenames if unsure.

RSYNC_TIMEOUT
Purpose: Maximum time (in seconds) to allow for rsync
operations when moving files to their final destinations.
Units: Seconds
Range: 30-1800 (recommended)
Default: 300 (5 minutes)
Note: Increase this if you are transferring very large
files (e.g., 4K remuxes) or if your destination is on a
slow network share.

STABLE_CHECKS_DROP_FOLDER
Purpose: The number of consecutive checks (with no size
or modification date changes) needed before a file or
folder in the DROP_FOLDER is considered "stable" and
ready for processing. This is crucial for preventing
JellyMac AMP from trying to process incomplete downloads
or transfers.
Range: 1-10 (recommended)
Default: 3
Note: Higher values are safer but may introduce a slight
delay before processing starts.

STABLE_SLEEP_INTERVAL_DROP_FOLDER
Purpose: The time (in seconds) to wait between each
stability check for items in the DROP_FOLDER.
Units: Seconds
Range: 1-60 (recommended)
Default: 10
Impact: Total stability wait time = STABLE_CHECKS *
STABLE_SLEEP_INTERVAL.

                  JELLYFIN INTEGRATION

Settings for connecting to your Jellyfin media server. If you
don't use Jellyfin, or don't want automatic library scans,
you can leave JELLYFIN_SERVER blank.

JELLYFIN_SERVER
Purpose: The full base URL of your Jellyfin server,
including the protocol (http or https) and port.
Format: http(s)://hostname_or_ip:port
Example: "http://192.168.1.100:8096" or
"https://mydomain.com/jellyfin"
Note: Must be accessible from the Mac running
JellyMac AMP. Leave blank to disable all Jellyfin
integration features.

JELLYFIN_API_KEY
Purpose: Your API key for Jellyfin, allowing JellyMac AMP
to trigger library scans.
Required: Yes, if JELLYFIN_SERVER is set and you want
library scans.
How to get: In Jellyfin, go to Dashboard -> API Keys ->
Click "+" to create a new key. Give it a name like
"JellyMacAMP".
Note: Keep this key secure.

ENABLE_JELLYFIN_SCAN_MOVIES

Prerequisite: ENABLE_TORRENT_AUTOMATION must also be
"true".

TORRENT_CLIENT_CLI_PATH
Purpose: The full path to the transmission-remote
command-line tool, which JellyMac AMP uses to communicate
with your Transmission daemon.
Required: Yes, if ENABLE_TORRENT_AUTOMATION is "true".
Default: "/opt/homebrew/bin/transmission-remote"
(common Homebrew path for transmission-cli package).
Note: Ensure transmission-cli is installed via
Homebrew (brew install transmission-cli).

TRANSMISSION_REMOTE_HOST
Purpose: The address and port for your Transmission
daemon's RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interface.
Format: hostname:port
Default: "localhost:9091" (standard for a local
Transmission daemon).
Note: If Transmission is running on a different machine,
update this accordingly.

TRANSMISSION_REMOTE_AUTH
Purpose: Username and password for Transmission RPC, if
you have enabled authentication in Transmission's
settings.
Format: "username:password"
Default: "" (empty, meaning no authentication).
Note: Leave empty if your Transmission setup does not
require a username/password for RPC access.

                   YOUTUBE PROCESSING

Settings for downloading and handling YouTube videos using yt-dlp.

ENABLE_CLIPBOARD_YOUTUBE
Purpose: Controls whether JellyMac AMP monitors the
clipboard for YouTube video links to download.
Values: "true" (default), "false"

DOWNLOAD_ARCHIVE_YOUTUBE
Purpose: Path to a text file used by yt-dlp to keep
track of video IDs that have already been downloaded.
This prevents re-downloading the same video.
Required: Yes, if ENABLE_CLIPBOARD_YOUTUBE is "true".
Default: "${JELLYMAC_PROJECT_ROOT}/.yt_download_archive.txt"
Note: The path must be writable by JellyMac AMP.

COOKIES_ENABLED
Purpose: Enable or disable the use of a cookies file for
YouTube downloads. This can sometimes help with accessing
age-restricted videos or content that requires login,
but may also interfere with some download methods if
YouTube changes its streaming techniques (e.g., SABR).
Values:
- "true": Enable cookies if COOKIES_FILE is also set.
- "false": Disable cookies (default).
Recommendation: Try with "false" first. Only enable if
you encounter issues downloading specific videos that
might require login/age verification.

COOKIES_FILE
Purpose: Path to your cookies.txt file for YouTube.com.
This file should be in the Netscape cookie format.
Optional: Yes. Only used if COOKIES_ENABLED is "true".
Example: "/Users/yourname/Documents/youtube_cookies.txt"
How to get: Typically exported from your web browser
using a browser extension designed for exporting cookies
(search for "cookies.txt export" for your browser).

YTDLP_FORMAT
Purpose: Specifies the preferred video and audio
format/quality string for yt-dlp to download.
Required: Yes, if ENABLE_CLIPBOARD_YOUTUBE is "true".
Default: "bv[height<=1080][vcodec=vp9]+ba[acodec=opus]/bv[height<=1080]+ba/best"
This attempts to get the best video up to 1080p
(preferring VP9 codec) combined with the best audio
(preferring Opus codec), falling back to other options
if the preferred ones are not available.
The square brackets [ and ] are used literally by
yt-dlp and should not be escaped with backslashes in
this configuration value. Proper quoting in the script
ensures they are passed correctly.
Note: yt-dlp format selection is very powerful. Refer
to the yt-dlp documentation for more details and
options: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#format-selection

YTDLP_OPTS
Purpose: An array of additional command-line options to
pass to yt-dlp for every download.
Format: Array of strings, e.g., ("--no-playlist" "--embed-metadata")
Default: ( --no-playlist --merge-output-format mkv --embed-metadata --restrict-filenames )
These defaults process only single videos (not whole
playlists), merge output into an MKV container, embed
metadata, and ensure filenames are safe for filesystems.
Required: Yes, if ENABLE_CLIPBOARD_YOUTUBE is "true".
Note: You can add other yt-dlp options here as needed.

                     USER INTERFACE

notifications played via the afplay command.
Values: "true" (default), "false"
Note: Only works on macOS. Requires afplay.

SOUND_INPUT_DETECTED_FILE
Purpose: Path to the sound file (.aiff, .mp3, .wav, etc.)
played when new input (e.g., clipboard link, new file
in drop folder) is detected by JellyMac AMP.
Default: "/System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff"

SOUND_TASK_SUCCESS_FILE
Purpose: Path to the sound file played on successful
completion of a major task (e.g., a media item is fully
processed and moved).
Default: "/System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff"

SOUND_TASK_ERROR_FILE

Purpose: Controls the verbosity of messages logged to the
console and, if enabled, to log files.
Values:
- "DEBUG": Most verbose. Use for troubleshooting detailed
issues. Shows step-by-step operations.
- "INFO": Standard operational messages (default). Shows
major actions and status updates.
- "WARN": Warnings about potential issues that don't stop
the script but might need attention.
- "ERROR": Only critical errors that likely halt a
specific task or the script.
Default: "INFO"

LOG_ROTATION_ENABLED
Purpose: Enable or disable automatic log file rotation.
When enabled, a new log file is created daily (if the
script runs), and old logs are deleted based on
LOG_RETENTION_DAYS.
Values: "true" (default), "false" (logs will append to a
single file or not be written if LOG_DIR isn't set).

LOG_DIR
Purpose: The directory where log files will be stored if
LOG_ROTATION_ENABLED is "true".
Required: Yes, if LOG_ROTATION_ENABLED is "true".
Default: "${JELLYMAC_PROJECT_ROOT}/logs"
Note: Will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
and AUTO_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS is "true".

/dev/null (e.g., HISTORY_FILE="/dev/null").

             ADVANCED / CUSTOM TOOL PATHS

Optional settings to override default paths for command-line
tools. JellyMac AMP will typically find these tools if they
are in standard Homebrew locations or your system's PATH.
Only uncomment and modify these if your tools are installed
in very non-standard locations.

YTDLP_PATH
Purpose: Override path to yt-dlp executable.
Example: "/usr/local/custom_bin/yt-dlp"

TORRENT_CLIENT_CLI_PATH
Purpose: Override path to transmission-remote.
Note: This setting is primarily managed by the
TORRENT_CLIENT_CLI_PATH variable in the "TORRENT
AUTOMATION" section. Using that one is preferred. This
entry here is mostly for completeness if a user prefers
to group all custom paths.

RSYNC_PATH
Purpose: Override path to rsync executable.
Example: "/opt/custom/rsync"

FLOCK_PATH
Purpose: Override path to flock executable.
Example: "/usr/local/opt/util-linux/bin/flock" (example
